## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

-  Download or clone the repository

```
$ git clone https://github.com/danielgp1/Discord-GameBot.git
```
    
-  Install the necessary plugins using

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

-  Create a Discord Bot in the Discord Developer Portal

```
https://discord.com/developers/applications
```
    
-  Give the bot Administrator Rights and invite it to your server
    
-  Replace the TOKEN and CHANNEL_ID values in the config.py file

```
PREFIX = "!"
TOKEN = 'YOUR DISCORD BOT TOKEN'
CHANNEL_ID = YOUR TEXT CHANNEL ID
```

-  To start the bot, run the following file from the project

```
main.py
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

In order to be able to play games with the bot, you have to be assigned the <code>Games</code> role. <br>
First, add the roles Blue,Red and Games to your server. Write <code>!teams</code> in a text channel and copy the ID of the message <br>
Replace the  <code>ourMessageID = ID</code> with the ID of your message in the functions <code>on_raw_reaction_add</code> and <code>on_raw_reaction_remove</code> in <code>main.py </code> <br>
You can be granted the role by clicking on the üéÆ emoji on the message
